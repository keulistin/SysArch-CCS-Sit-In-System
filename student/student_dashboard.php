                        <p>To avoid embarrassment and maintain camaraderie with your friends and superiors at our laboratories, please observe the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Maintain silence, proper decorum, and discipline inside the laboratory. Mobile phones, walkmans, and other personal pieces of equipment must be switched off.</p>
                        <p>2. Games are not allowed inside the lab. This includes computer-related games, card games, and other games that may disturb the operation of the lab.</p>
                        <p>3. Surfing the Internet is allowed only with the permission of the instructor. Downloading and installing of software are strictly prohibited.</p>
                        <p>4. Getting access to other websites not related to the course (especially pornographic and illicit sites) is strictly prohibited.</p>
                        <p>5. Deleting computer files and changing the set-up of the computer is a major offense.</p>
                        <p>6. Observe computer time usage carefully. A fifteen-minute allowance is given for each use. Otherwise, the unit will be given to those who wish to "sit-in."</p>
                        <p>7. Observe proper decorum while inside the laboratory.</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>8. Chewing gum, eating, drinking, smoking, and other forms of vandalism are prohibited inside the lab.</p>
                        <p>9. Anyone causing a continual disturbance will be asked to leave the lab. Acts or gestures offensive to the members of the community, including public display of physical intimacy, are not tolerated.</p>
                        <p>10. Persons exhibiting hostile or threatening behavior such as yelling, swearing, or disregarding requests made by lab personnel will be asked to leave the lab.</p>
                        <p>11. For serious offenses, the lab personnel may call the Civil Security Office (CSU) for assistance.</p>
